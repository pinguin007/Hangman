# Hangman

A gaming project that brings you the classic game of Hang Man using the Python Tkinter GUI.

The Game picks a random word out of the 10,000 most commonly used English words. If the player guesses a letter which occurs in the word, the game writes it in all its correct positions. 
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the game draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

The game features include:
keyboard: Displays Green when the correct letter is selected, and Red when the wrong letter is selected.
Word Display: Shows the correct letters on the top part of the screen. Shows the mystery word when all letters are correct
Hang Man Display: Shows the different stages of the hanged man stick figure.
Winner Screen/loser screen.
